This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to the IsEmpty function's handling of variant data types. The bug.vbs file shows the problematic code, while bugSolution.vbs offers a corrected version.  The core issue stems from inconsistent behavior of IsEmpty when dealing with potentially empty variant types passed as function arguments.  The solution uses more robust type checking to handle various scenarios reliably.  This example highlights the importance of careful type handling in VBScript and provides a practical demonstration of a common pitfall to avoid.
